Daniela Amodei argues the next phase won’t be won by the biggest pre-training runs alone, but by who can deliver the most capability per dollar of compute. Heading into 2026, with both labs running as if they could go public while still raising fresh capital, it's a question of brute-force scale versus efficiency.\nIf OpenAI is attempting to anchor a vast buildout around bespoke campuses and dedicated capacity, Anthropic is trying to remain flexible, shifting where it runs based on cost, availability, and customer demand, while focusing internal energy on improving model efficiency and performance per unit of compute. As 2026 begins, the divide matters for another reason: Both companies are being pushed toward the discipline of public-market readiness while still operating in a private-market world where compute needs are growing faster than certainty.\nIn that sense, Anthropic's contrarian bet isn't that scaling doesn't work. It's that scaling isn't the only lever that matters, and that the winner of the next phase may be the lab that can keep improving while spending in a way the real economy can sustain. \"The exponential continues until it doesn't,\" Daniela Amodei said. The question for 2026 is what happens to the AI arms race — and to the companies building it — if the industry's favorite curve finally stops behaving.\nDaniela Amodei and her brother, Dario Amodei, who is Anthropic's CEO, helped build the very worldview they're now betting against.","favicon":"https://favicons.linkup.so?domain=www.cnbc.com","name":"Anthropic's 'do more with less' bet has kept it at the AI frontier, co-founder Amodei tells CNBC","type":"text","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html"},{"content":"Ty Roush&#x27;s stories.
